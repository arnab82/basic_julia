1. Introduction to the `case` statement in Bash:

   - The `case` statement in Bash allows you to perform conditional branching based on pattern matching.
   - It provides an alternative to multiple `if-else` statements when you need to check a variable against different patterns or values.
2. Syntax and usage of the `case` statement:

   - The `case` statement starts with the keyword `case`, followed by the variable or expression to be tested.
   - Each case is specified using the `pattern)` syntax, followed by a block of code to be executed if the pattern matches.
   - The `case` statement ends with the `esac` keyword.

   ```bash
   case variable/expression in
       pattern1)
           # code to execute if pattern1 matches
           ;;
       pattern2)
           # code to execute if pattern2 matches
           ;;
       pattern3)
           # code to execute if pattern3 matches
           ;;
       *)
           # code to execute if no patterns match
           ;;
   esac
   ```
3. Pattern matching with `case`:

   - Patterns in the `case` statement can include wildcards, character ranges, and other matching options.
   - Common pattern matching options in Bash include `*` (matches any sequence of characters), `?` (matches any single character), and `[...]` (matches any character in the specified range or set).
4. Examples of `case` statements in Bash scripts:
   Example 1: Matching a single value with patterns.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   fruit="apple"

   case $fruit in
       apple)
           echo "It's an apple."
           ;;
       banana)
           echo "It's a banana."
           ;;
       orange)
           echo "It's an orange."
           ;;
       *)
           echo "It's an unknown fruit."
           ;;
   esac
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   It's an apple.
   ```

   Example 2: Pattern matching with wildcards and character ranges.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   day="Monday"

   case $day in
       [Mm][Oo][Nn]*)
           echo "It's a Monday."
           ;;
       [Tt][Uu][Ee][Ss]*)
           echo "It's a Tuesday."
           ;;
       [Ww]*)
           echo "It's a Wednesday."
           ;;
       *)
           echo "It's an unknown day."
           ;;
   esac
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   It's a Monday.
   ```

   Example 3: Using `*)` to match any other value.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   number=7

   case $number in
       1)
           echo "It's one."
           ;;
       2)
           echo "It's two."
           ;;
       3)
           echo "It's three."
           ;;
       *)
           echo "It's an unknown number."
           ;;
   esac
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   It's an unknown number.
   ```

These examples demonstrate the usage of the `case` statement in Bash scripts. By using pattern matching, you can easily handle different scenarios and execute specific code blocks based on the matched patterns or values of variables.
