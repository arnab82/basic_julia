1. Syntax and usage of the `until` loop:

   - The `until` loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition becomes true.
   - The loop continues until the condition evaluates to true.
   - The basic syntax of an `until` loop is as follows:

   ```bash
   until [ condition ]; do
       # code to execute
   done
   ```

   - The condition can be any logical or arithmetic expression that evaluates to either true (non-zero) or false (zero).
   - The loop executes the code block between `do` and `done` repeatedly until the condition becomes true.
2. Executing code block repeatedly until a condition becomes true:

   - The `until` loop starts by checking the condition.
   - If the condition is false, the code block is executed.
   - After executing the code block, the loop goes back to check the condition again.
   - If the condition is still false, the code block is executed again, and this process continues until the condition becomes true.
3. Examples of `until` loops in Bash scripts:
   Example 1: Printing numbers from 1 to 5 using an `until` loop.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   count=1

   until [ $count -gt 5 ]; do
       echo $count
       ((count++))
   done
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   1
   2
   3
   4
   5
   ```

   Example 2: Generating a random number between 1 and 10 using an `until` loop.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   number=0

   until [ $number -ge 1 ] && [ $number -le 10 ]; do
       number=$((RANDOM % 20))
       echo "Generated number: $number"
   done
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   Generated number: 16
   Generated number: 8
   ```

   The loop continues to generate random numbers until a number between 1 and 10 is generated.

The `until` loop allows you to execute a code block repeatedly until a condition becomes true. It's useful when you want to execute a block of code until a particular condition is met, similar to a "do-while" loop in other programming languages.
