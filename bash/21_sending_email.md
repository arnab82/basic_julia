1. Sending email notifications from a Bash script:

   - Bash scripts can send email notifications to alert users or send reports.
   - There are multiple ways to send email from a Bash script, including using the `mail` command or sending through an SMTP server.
2. Using the `mail` command:

   - The `mail` command is a simple way to send email from a Bash script.
   - You can specify the recipient, subject, and message content using command-line options or by providing input to the command.
3. Sending through SMTP:

   - To send email through an SMTP server, you can use third-party libraries or tools that support SMTP communication, such as `ssmtp` or `msmtp`.
   - These tools allow you to configure SMTP settings, such as the server address, port, authentication, and TLS/SSL options.
4. Configuring email settings and formatting messages:

   - Depending on the method used, you may need to configure email settings in your Bash script, such as the sender's address, recipient's address, SMTP server details, and authentication credentials.
   - You can format the email message using variables or command substitution to include dynamic content.
5. Examples of sending email via Bash scripts:

Example 1: Sending email using the `mail` command:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

recipient="recipient@example.com"
subject="Email subject"
message="Hello, this is the email body."

echo "$message" | mail -s "$subject" "$recipient"
```

Example 2: Sending email through SMTP using `ssmtp`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

recipient="recipient@example.com"
subject="Email subject"
message="Hello, this is the email body."

echo -e "To: $recipient\nSubject: $subject\n\n$message" | ssmtp "$recipient"
```

Example 3: Sending email through SMTP using `msmtp`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

recipient="recipient@example.com"
subject="Email subject"
message="Hello, this is the email body."

echo -e "To: $recipient\nSubject: $subject\n\n$message" | msmtp --from=default -t "$recipient"
```

In these examples, the recipient's email address, subject, and message content are provided in the script. The message is either piped or passed as input to the `mail`, `ssmtp`, or `msmtp` command to send the email.

Note: Configuring SMTP settings and installing the necessary tools may vary depending on your system and requirements. Ensure that you have the appropriate permissions and consult the documentation of the specific tools for further configuration instructions.
