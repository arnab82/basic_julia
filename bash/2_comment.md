1. Adding comments in Bash scripts:

   - Comments are lines in the script that are not executed as commands. They are used to provide explanations, clarify code, and make it more readable and maintainable.
   - In Bash, comments start with the `#` symbol.
2. Using `#` to start a comment:

   - To add a comment in a Bash script, simply start the line with `#`.
   - Anything following the `#` symbol on that line will be treated as a comment and ignored by the interpreter.

   Example:

   ```bash
   # This is a comment in a Bash script.
   ```
3. The purpose and importance of comments in code:

   - Comments serve as documentation and provide context to understand the code.
   - They make the script more readable and help other developers (including your future self) understand your intentions and logic.
   - Comments can explain complex or non-obvious sections of the code, describe algorithms, or provide usage instructions.
   - Comments also facilitate debugging and troubleshooting by providing additional information about specific parts of the script.
   - They enable easier maintenance and updates of the script by allowing you or other developers to understand and modify it more efficiently.

   Example:

   ```bash
   # This script calculates the sum of two numbers.
   # Prompt the user for input.
   echo "Enter the first number:"
   read num1
   echo "Enter the second number:"
   read num2

   # Calculate the sum.
   sum=$((num1 + num2))

   # Display the result.
   echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $sum."
   ```

   In the example above, comments are used to describe the purpose of the script, explain user prompts, and clarify the calculation and output.

Adding comments to your Bash scripts is highly recommended to enhance readability, maintainability, and collaboration. It's a good practice to provide clear and concise comments that explain the script's functionality and any important details or assumptions.
